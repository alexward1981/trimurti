Any development tasks or optimisations which need to be made should be listed here.

**Note:** If there is a task/bug manager in place to cover this then this file will not be updated.

## Tasks:
1. Work out how to structure the vulcan folders
2. Work out how the schema will be mapped out

## Issues
1. There is a potential issue with path resolution. I need to make sure that the 'vulcan' folder is placed in the correct place for any project it's in. This will probably require config.
